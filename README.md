# spring-boot-kong
Example project showing how to integrate Spring Boot microservices with Kong API Gateway



### Step by step...

Some microservices to access with Kong... I once worked heavily with the Spring Cloud Netflix tooling.

Here's the example project: https://github.com/jonashackt/cxf-spring-cloud-netflix-docker and the blog post I wrote back then https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2017/05/ansible-docker-windows-containers-scaling-spring-cloud-netflix-docker-compose

The goal is to rebuild the project using Kong https://github.com/Kong/kong
