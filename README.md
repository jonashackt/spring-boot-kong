Example project showing how to integrate Spring Boot microservices with Kong API Gateway


Bringing together Kong & Spring Boot. But wait, what is https://github.com/Kong/kong ?

> Kong is a cloud-native, fast, scalable, and distributed Microservice Abstraction Layer (also known as an API Gateway or API Middleware). 


### Step by step...

Some microservices to access with Kong... I once worked heavily with the Spring Cloud Netflix tooling.

Here's the example project: https://github.com/jonashackt/cxf-spring-cloud-netflix-docker and the blog post I wrote back then https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2017/05/ansible-docker-windows-containers-scaling-spring-cloud-netflix-docker-compose

The goal is to rebuild the project using Kong https://github.com/Kong/kong


### Idea & Setup

Konga GUI

docker-compose

Integration: OpenAPI - Spring - Kong - Insomnia Designer



agnostical! more pattern like

Setup idea: Spring Boot REST / WebFlux --> [generate OpenAPI spec yamls via springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-rest-openapi-documentation) --> Insomnia config file with [Kong Bundle plugin](https://insomnia.rest/plugins/insomnia-plugin-kong-bundle/) --> import into Kong and run via decK (normal Kong gateway without EE)

Nothing really there right now:  https://www.google.com/search?q=openapi+spring+boot+kong

* No change in Spring Boot dev workflow required, no custom annotations
* elegant integration of Kong and Spring Boot services

PLUS: CI process to regularly generate OpenAPI specs from Spring code -> and automatically import into Kong, which is an enterprise feature - or it is possible via:

Insomnia Inso CLI (https://support.insomnia.rest/collection/105-inso-cli)

See "From OpenAPI spec to configuration as code" in https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2020/09/offloading-and-more-from-reedelk-data-integration-services-through-kong-enterprise/


Next:
(backwards: OpenAPI --> Kong --> code)





### Create a Spring Boot App with REST endpoints

This is the easy part. We all know where to start: Go to start.spring.io and create a Spring REST app skeleton.

As I wanted to rebuild my good old Spring Cloud Netflix / Eureka based apps, I simply too the `weatherbackend` app from https://github.com/jonashackt/cxf-spring-cloud-netflix-docker/tree/master/weatherbackend

But why didn't I go with a reactive WebFlux based app? 


##### The current problem with springdoc-openapi and WebFlux based Spring Boot apps

WebFlux based Spring Boot Apps need some `springdoc-openapi` specific classes right now in order to fully generate the OpenAPI live documentation in the end. See the demos at

https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi-demos

And especially the webflux functional demo at: https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi-demos/blob/master/springdoc-openapi-spring-boot-2-webflux-functional where these imports are used:

```java
import static org.springdoc.core.fn.builders.apiresponse.Builder.responseBuilder;
import static org.springdoc.core.fn.builders.parameter.Builder.parameterBuilder;
import static org.springdoc.webflux.core.fn.SpringdocRouteBuilder.route;
```

I can fully discourage to go with this approach, but for this project I wanted a 100% "springdoc-free" standard Spring Boot app, where the springdoc feature are __ONLY__ used to generate OpenAPI specs - and not rely onto some dependencies from springdoc. Since that would imply that every Spring Boot project that wanted to adopt the solution outlined here would need to integrate springdoc classes in their projects.



### Generate an OpenAPI spec with the springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin

See the docs at https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin on how to use the springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin.

> The aim of springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin is to generate json and yaml OpenAPI description during build time. The plugin works during integration-tests phase, and generates the OpenAPI description. The plugin works in conjunction with spring-boot-maven plugin.

But in order to successfully run the springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin, we need to add the [springdoc-openapi-ui](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi) plugin (for Tomcat / Spring MVC based apps) or the [springdoc-openapi-webflux-ui](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi#spring-webflux-support-with-annotated-controllers) plugin (for Reactive WebFlux / Netty based apps) to our [hellobackend/pom.xml](hellobackend/pom.xml):

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
    <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-webflux-ui</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.8</version>
</dependency>
```

Otherwise the `springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin` will run into errors like this (as described [in this so answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/64677754/4964553)):

```
[INFO] --- springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin:1.1:generate (default) @ hellobackend ---
[ERROR] An error has occured: Response code 404
[INFO]
[INFO] --- spring-boot-maven-plugin:2.3.5.RELEASE:stop (post-integration-test) @ hellobackend ---
[INFO] Stopping application...
2020-11-04 10:18:36.851  INFO 42036 --- [on(4)-127.0.0.1] inMXBeanRegistrar$SpringApplicationAdmin : Application shutdown requested.
```

As a sidenote: if you fire up your Spring Boot app from here with `mvn spring-boot:run`, you can access the live API documentation already at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

![openapi-swagger-ui](screenshots/openapi-swagger-ui.png)

Now we can add the `springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin` to our [hellobackend/pom.xml](hellobackend/pom.xml):

```xml
	<build>
		<plugins>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
				<executions>
					<execution>
						<id>pre-integration-test</id>
						<goals>
							<goal>start</goal>
						</goals>
					</execution>
					<execution>
						<id>post-integration-test</id>
						<goals>
							<goal>stop</goal>
						</goals>
					</execution>
				</executions>
			</plugin>
			<plugin>
				<groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
				<artifactId>springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin</artifactId>
				<version>1.1</version>
				<executions>
					<execution>
						<phase>integration-test</phase>
						<goals>
							<goal>generate</goal>
						</goals>
					</execution>
				</executions>
			</plugin>
		</plugins>
	</build>
``` 

As you see we also need to tell the `spring-boot-maven-plugin` to start and stop the integration test phases.

In order to generate the Open API spec we need to execute Maven with:

```
mvn verify
```

The output should contain something like that:

```
...
[INFO] --- springdoc-openapi-maven-plugin:1.1:generate (default) @ hellobackend ---
2020-11-04 10:26:09.579  INFO 42143 --- [ctor-http-nio-2] o.springdoc.api.AbstractOpenApiResource  : Init duration for springdoc-openapi is: 29 ms
...
```

This indicates that the OpenAPI spec generation was successful. Therefore we need to have a look into the `weatherbackend/target` directory, where a file called [openapi.json](weatherbackend/target/openapi.json) should be present now (you may need to reformat the code inside you IDE to not look into a one-liner ;) ):

```json
{
  "openapi": "3.0.1",
  "info": {
    "title": "OpenAPI definition",
    "version": "v0"
  },
  "servers": [
    {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080",
      "description": "Generated server url"
    }
  ],
  "paths": {
    "/weather/general/outlook": {
      "get": {
        "tags": [
          "weather-backend-controller"
        ],
        "operationId": "infoAboutGeneralOutlook",
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "OK",
            "content": {
              "application/json": {
                "schema": {
                  "type": "string"
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
}}}
```


### Import OpenAPI spec into Kong

First we start the manual process in order to test drive our solution.

##### Install Insomnia Desinger with Kong Bundle plugin

On a Mac simply use brew (or have a look at https://insomnia.rest):

```
brew cask install insomnia-designer
```

Then go to https://insomnia.rest/plugins/insomnia-plugin-kong-bundle and click on `Install in Designer` & open the request in Insomnia Desinger:

![insomnia-designer-kong-bundle-plugin](screenshots/insomnia-designer-kong-bundle-plugin.png)


##### Import Springdoc generated openapi.json into Insomnia Designer

Now let's try to import the generated [openapi.json](weatherbackend/target/openapi.json) into our Insomnia Designer by clicking on `Create` and then `Import from / File`:

![insomnia-designer-import-openapi-json](screenshots/insomnia-designer-import-openapi-json.png)

That was easy :) Now you can already interact with your API through Insomnia.



##### Generate Kong Declarative Config from Openapi

The next step is to generate the Kong configuration from the OpenAPI specification. Therefore we need to click on the `Generate Config` button:

![insomnia-designer-kong-declarative-config](screenshots/insomnia-designer-kong-declarative-config.png)

And voil√† we have our Kong declarative configuration ready:

```yaml
_format_version: "1.1"
services:
  - name: OpenAPI_definition
    url: http://localhost:8080
    plugins: []
    routes:
      - tags:
          - OAS3_import
        name: OpenAPI_definition-path-get
        methods:
          - GET
        paths:
          - /weather/general/outlook
        strip_path: false
      - tags:
          - OAS3_import
        name: OpenAPI_definition-path_1-post
        methods:
          - POST
        paths:
          - /weather/general/outlook
        strip_path: false
      - tags:
          - OAS3_import
        name: OpenAPI_definition-path_2-get
        methods:
          - GET
        paths:
          - /weather/(?<name>\S+)$
        strip_path: false
    tags:
      - OAS3_import
upstreams:
  - name: OpenAPI_definition
    targets:
      - target: localhost:8080
    tags:
      - OAS3_import

```

For now let's save this yaml inside the [kong/kong.yml](kong/kong.yml) file.


##### Import Kong Declarative config into Kong with decK

As my colleague [Daniel Kocot already outlined](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2019/12/kong-api-gateway-declarative-configuration-using-deck-and-visualizations-with-konga/) there is [decK](https://github.com/Kong/deck) for declarative config handling for Kong.

With the help of `decK` we should be able to import the declarative configuration into Kong.




### Create a Kong infrastructure

Official Kong docker-compose template: https://github.com/Kong/docker-kong/blob/master/compose/docker-compose.yml

https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2019/09/api-management-kong-update/

https://github.com/danielkocot/kong-blogposts/blob/master/docker-compose.yml


First question: What is this `kong-migration` Docker container about? [Daniel answers it](https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2019/09/api-management-kong-update/):

> the kong-migration service is used for the initial generation of the objects in the kong-database. Unfortunately, the configuration of the database is not managed by the kong service.





##### Docker Compose with Kong DB-less deployment & declarative configuration

I have two goals here: First I want a simple deployment solution. If I could avoid it then I don't want to have multiple services only for the API gateway. I want to start small and you as a reader should be able to easily follow.

As [the official Docker Compose file](https://github.com/Kong/docker-kong/blob/master/compose/docker-compose.yml) has two (!!) database migration services, one database service and one service for Kong I was really overwhelmed at first.

What I learned in my years in the IT industry: Every component you don't have is a good component. So there must be a way to deploy Kong without that much "hassle". And I found one:

 
The documentation at https://docs.konghq.com/2.2.x/db-less-and-declarative-config/ says, that DB-less mode is possible since Kong 1.1 and has a number of benefits:

* reduced number of dependencies: no need to manage a database installation if the entire setup for your use-cases fits in memory
* it is a good fit for automation in CI/CD scenarios: configuration for entities can be kept in a single source of truth managed via a Git repository
* it enables more deployment options for Kong

But be aware that are also some drawbacks. [Not all plugins support this mode]https://docs.konghq.com/2.2.x/db-less-and-declarative-config/#plugin-compatibility) and [there is no central configuration database](https://docs.konghq.com/2.2.x/db-less-and-declarative-config/#no-central-database-coordination) if you want to run multiple Kong nodes. But for our simple setup we should be able to live with that. 

There's some info in the docs at https://docs.konghq.com/install/docker how to spin up Kong in DB-less mode

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55587114/kong-db-less-in-docker


So let's do it. I'll try to setup the simplest possible `docker-compose.yml` here in order to spin up Kong. I'll derive it [from the official one](https://github.com/Kong/docker-kong/blob/master/compose/docker-compose.yml), the one my colleague Daniel Kocot [used in his blog posts](https://github.com/danielkocot/kong-blogposts/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) and others [like this](https://medium.com/@matias_azucas/db-less-kong-tutorial-8cbf8f70b266). 

```yaml
version: '3.7'

services:
  kong:
    image: kong:2.2.0
    environment:
      KONG_ADMIN_ACCESS_LOG: /dev/stdout
      KONG_ADMIN_ERROR_LOG: /dev/stderr
      KONG_ADMIN_LISTEN: '0.0.0.0:8001'
      KONG_DATABASE: "off"
      KONG_DECLARATIVE_CONFIG: /usr/local/kong/declarative/kong.yml
      KONG_PROXY_ACCESS_LOG: /dev/stdout
      KONG_PROXY_ERROR_LOG: /dev/stderr
    volumes:
      - ./kong/:/usr/local/kong/declarative
    networks:
      - kong-net
    ports:
      - "8000:8000/tcp"
      - "127.0.0.1:8001:8001/tcp"
      - "8443:8443/tcp"
      - "127.0.0.1:8444:8444/tcp"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "kong", "health"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 10
    restart: on-failure
    deploy:
      restart_policy:
        condition: on-failure

  # no portbinding here - the actual services should be accessible through Kong
  weatherbackend:
    build: ./weatherbackend
    ports:
      - "8080"
    networks:
      - kong-net
    tty:
      true
    restart:
      unless-stopped

networks:
  kong-net:
    external: false
```
 








### Automating the OpenAPI-Kong import

We need to also import the OpenAPI spec everytime the code changes, since otherwise the configuration in Kong will differ with every commit!

Additionally we want to be able to run our process on our CI servers as well, since we're in 2020 and want to be sure everything runs even after code changes.
